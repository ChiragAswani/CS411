As a logged in user with my accounts connected, I want to view my calendar in various formats (day, week, month, etc) toggle which calendars from which sites I see.
I want to be able to create, view, edit, and delete events from each website on my personal calendar and on the actual website's calendar. I want to see notifications and reminders
about upcoming events.
