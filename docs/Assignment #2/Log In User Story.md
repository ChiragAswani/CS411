As a new user, I want to create an account with an username and password. This should be unique and not similar to any other usernames. Additionally, the user's username should be visible as they are typing, however, the password shouldnt show. Next I should be able to authorize the featured applications: Twitter, Facebook, Google, Slack. Then be taken to the Web Page

As an existing user, I want to be able to automatically be signed in like Facebook, where I just type facebook.com and it pulls up my home web page. Additionally, if I need to reauthentication, I can select that, as well as log out. 

A user will not be able to access our features or use our application if their authentication details is invalid
