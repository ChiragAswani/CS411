Google Calendar API
1. Once we set up oAuth for google calendar, we have the ability to 
 - add new calendars to their exsisting account
 - edit exsisting calendars to their exsisting account
2. Hopefully we can export the calendars from Twitter, Slack, Facebook into a CSV format, because then we can easily import that to their account using the API

Google Hangouts API
1. Link: https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/
2. I've been trying to look for tutorials and ways to integrate hangouts but it looks like you can only make a bot, not have access to their current messages
