#Why Technology Stack
We chose to use MongoDB for the database and Node.js for the backend and pug for the front end(if needed). We chose these for various reasons. First, we were new to all of them and found out that they are very desirable skills to have in the job market. Second, Node has more documentation than Flask (our other option). Lastly, we decided to use MongoDB instead of a relational database like SQL because we weren't going to use data that required relations, only the username would be the lookup. Lastly, we decided to not use Angular because we wanted to solidify our knowledge of Node, JavaScript, Mongo, and HTML (all fairly new languages to us). Therefore, we didn't think we would have enough time to learn another framework.
