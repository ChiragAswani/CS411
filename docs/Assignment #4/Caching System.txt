They way our caching works is as follows:
1. A user signs up for an account
2. username and password gets stored in DB and is cached using cookie-parser
4. once a user goes back into homepage (localhost:8000) and wants to sign in again, he clicks log in
5. login reads the current cache (username: xxx) (password: xxx) and checks if that is in the db
6. If in the database: go to homepage, if it is not in the db: go to the login page
7. Logout clears the cookies
