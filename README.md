# Socialite
Project for CS 411 at Boston University - Software Engineering

## Description
Socialite is a platform to view your messages, calendar, and newsfeed from popular social media sites into one platform. The goal is to have one area to view everything so there is less clutter in your life.

## Notes
- We were unable to use Facebook Messages and Facebook News Feed API due to Facebook's recent privacy scandal. They were not recieving any requests for new applications
- We were unable to use Google+ Hangouts API as it is no longer supported: https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/
